Hello, I'm Michael Lloyd. I was a student and worked at the University of New South Wales. 

My Github was cleaned up recently, but some projects you may want to check out are: 

<details>
  <summary><b>micl-arm-os (64-bit ARM kernel) </b></summary>
A custom, from-scratch, 64-bit ARM kernel. Loosely inspired by FreeBSD, it's a proper 
higher-half kernel that is designed to run on most ARMv8 devices. It's currently my main 
  project, and is not finished.

  <summary><b>click-and-collect-intll</b></summary>
The original click-and-collect is an interactive theorem prover for linear logic. I modified 
    it to support a variant of linear logic called "intuitionistic linear logic". This required 
    adding several thousands of lines of functional code. It's still a WIP for some features.

<details>
  <summary><b>PicoGamePad</b></summary>
  This was a PCB I designed, a basic game controller, that was meant to show students how 
  to solder and work with SMD components. This didn't go anywhere, but it's kind of cool.

  <summary><b>micromod_teensy_badapple</b></summary>
  This project plays "Bad Apple!!" on a Teensy microcontroller variant, at 30-35 FPS. This was 
  actually required some interesting steps, like encoding the video data into a custom format with
  RLE encoding. Generally, microcontrollers aren't meant to play videos like this. You can see a 
  demonstration of this at https://youtube.com/shorts/9pGKf29HdKk?si=gKOMJnr1MINRLJsd
