Welcome to my page. I am a student and staff member at the University of New South Wales.

If you are interested in viewing work done by me, first look at my pinned 
repositories, 

and for completed projects I recommend my [Website](https://micl.dev/projects) instead.

### Languages/Development Environments

My work will rarely be focused on one language, so these are only
what I am currently working with.

- Commandline scripting: perl, zsh, wolfram-language, sometimes JS
- OS Preferences: Arch, I maintain packages. They're on my site. 
- PCB EDA Software: KiCAD 6. I do not use Altium or Eagle, sorry. 
- Embedded Language Choice: C++/C w/ Cmake 3.12, 3.13, 3.18

### Focus Area's For 2022

- RP2040 based Microcontroller systems ([RP2040 Die Explorer](https://micl.dev/projects/rp2040_explorer), [RP2040 Distributed Computer](https://micl.dev/projects/rp2040_parallel_cpu))
- Image Sensors for Robotics (T.B.A)
- Planetary Surface Robotics (See the project I lead [Offworld Robotic, UNSW](https://micl.dev/projects/OWR))
- PCB manufacturing and design specification ([CircuitCompass](https://micl.dev/projects/circuit-compass))
- Human Interface Devices (See [The PicoGamePad](https://github.com/Michael-Lloyd/PicoGamePad) and [Keyboard](https://micl.dev/projects/keyboard))

Contact details are on my website. I do not respond to emails from people I don't know.
